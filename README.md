idea:
  * Use of topography map to mark places safe for certain disasters such as floods and also  provide the shortest and safest route to           reach the marked safe place.
  * Connecting the victim to the authority responsible for rescue in case of emergency. This way victim would not need to try different         phone numbers and other connecting methods and will always be certain of talking to the authority available, easily.
